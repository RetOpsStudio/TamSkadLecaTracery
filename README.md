## Project about:

Simple multiplayer FPS game made in UE4 (bp/c++) that can be played over lan or internet(with hamachi like tools).
Players can join up one of two teams - Red or Green, choose their loadouts and score victory by killing as much enemy players as they can while trying not to die by themselves.
  
## Main menu

The Main menu is first what we can see when we launch this game, it gives us access to Multi Player menu, where we can create or join existing game, settings menu, where we can adjust graphic and screen settings, and the Quit Game option.
