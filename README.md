## Project about:

Simple multiplayer FPS game made in UE4 (bp/c++) that can be played over lan or internet(with hamachi like tools).
Players can join up one of two teams - Red or Green, choose their loadouts and score victory by killing as much enemy players as they can while trying not to die by themselves.
  
## Main menu

The Main menu is first what we can see when we launch this game, it gives us access to multi player menu, where we can create or join existing game, settings menu, where we can adjust graphic and screen settings, and the Quit Game option.

## Multi Player menu
In MP menu we can choose our nickname and switch between two views - [Create Game](#create-game)(default) and [Find Game](#find-game). We can also click the back button to move back to Main menu.

### Create Game
Create Game view allows us to make a new game available for other players to join. We can choose map, server name and numbers of slots available to join, and after clicking "Host Game" button session will be started, we'll be moved [inside](#gameplay) and the game will appear in the game browswer included in [Find Game](#find-game) view.
